# Fog Of War Listener - FOWL 
## --- a network traffic inspection and injection tool.

> The "fog of war" is the uncertainty in situational awareness experienced by participants in military operations. 

> The term seeks to capture the uncertainty regarding one's own capability, adversary capability, and adversary intent during an engagement, operation, or campaign. 

> "The quieter you become, the more you are able to hear"

It appears for 2 reasons:

 1. Your sensor has not collected any data relevant to the visualizer-segment.
 2. In IP->IP graphs:
    - if you don't have the network configured for the interface used in collection, or 
    - ran a PCAP through `FOWL.py` with `-f $file`/`--pcap $file`

# Q & A 

</summary>

> # You: **What** is this?

In a few words: A firewall with somewhat limited but informative dissection capabilities, and more limited (atm) traffic injection capability.

It's also decent as a framework for packet dissection (if you know scapy <3), has segregated logging, *very basic* network modeling, and "indirect" passive host fingerprinting.


> # Ok... and **Why** is this?

I just like doing things like this. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

`I am a hacker, enter my world...`

`Yes, I am a criminal.  My crime is that of curiosity.  My crime is
that of judging people by what they say and think, not what they look like.` -

> `My crime is that of outsmarting you, something that you will never forgive me for.`

--- The Mentor

### Wait- Wait- OK- 
### specifically this,

No such tool existed that combines the functionality of a [port knocking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_knocking), 
[fail2ban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fail2ban), and... well I can't find anything technical/"official" to describe it, but its something between "phishing and fuzzing" of hacker tools/kits/scanners/**botnets**, and "a honeypot"(if I ever see my original dream to fruition, honeypot would be an inclusive term.)

Fairly early on, I decided a merge of those 3 things was "a solid thing to make", and provides a more foundational function than my "lame port scan responder" (The OG name.)

I deeply expand on "the why", and this vision at the very bottom of the readme - forewarning: its a lot. 

> # and I use it how? 

That depends...

Are you...
### Blue team - a firewall
  A basic sample is provided, `FOWLWALL.JSON`, that demonstrates the main 3 functions (bannable conditions, knock->unlock conditions, respond conditions AND actions, and BONUS: a simple notification service)

  More info on the rules of this file/the-tokenizer as they are written.

or, are you...
### Red team - a passive recon tool
  Running a captured `pcap` through `FoWL.py` analysis tools and viewing them in the visualizer is one approach to get a "big picture" of the network, and fairly easily discern what devices are in-view.

Really, all teams should have awareness of all tools - to prepare for the opposition - "Know your enemy."

# PRERELEASE TODO:
</summary>

 - Clean up the built-in `scapy_handler`s
   - Parallels: 
     - Add an engine method of adding/removing handlers with "some given scapy conditions to be satisfied" (or a default/fallback with no conditions being supplied)
     - Add calls of aforementioned callback to FoWLWall-tokenizer rules+their action handlers
 - Finish stateful connection tracking
 - Knocker daemon
 - Fail2Ban-esque
 - "Mirror mode" - described in purp team highlights
 - Add a license
</details>

<!-- # Highlights:

- Blue Team endeavors:
    - configurable to kin of a very-confusing firewall, or "hollow" honeypot (falsify banners and/or limited services - purely blue team)
      - Fun fact: This idea was actually my motiviation for the project - a Mirai botnet derivative kept throwing random router exploits at my servers
- Purple Team:
    - devious redirection to actual honeypots, or 
    - outright redirection of exploit attempts 
        - I'm calling this red-team-by-proxy --
            - redirect your own ports to your "targets" (perhaps... the origin?) - make the "enemy" work for you, or against themselves
              - A play on the classic: "You can't hack me, here's my IP: 127.0.0.1"
            - detect and steal their (basic) shells
- Red Team:
    - MITM/Service/Route Poisoning (expanded in TODO) -->

# Working:
</summary>

- Stateless emulation of basic HTTP/1.1 server
- Offline reanalysis of PCAPs
- Packet capture/analysis pipelines
- visualizer
  - MAC->MAC graph
    - MAC broadcasts are not considered in this graph
  - IP->IP graph
    - Using the information configured for the host network interface, subdivide traffic into LAN segments
      - I hope to change/add subdivisions per detected network ranges
        - E.G. DHCP Response contains this, as do broadcasts
- logging 
  - I personally prefer more to less (details), I will likely reduce the log verbosity, to at least reduce ->$file operations.
  - I also prefer file based division, but don't like the inconvenience of splicing a timeline/trace, so there is a "merged output streams" to "log/latest.log"

# Big TODO:

- Applicable to *
    - Streamline service emulation implementations
        - capture PCAPs/Pickles
        - auto analysis ~~~ magics ~~~
        - detect/emulate server responses?
    - Implement stateful monitoring of connections (TCP - SEQ/ACK tracking, DNS request/response pairs, etc)
    - root-less packet capture (Blue Team knocker daemon could use regular sockets, and if wireshark group is configured - Red Team gets Recon)
- Blue Team:
    - knocker daemon 
    - specific service emulation toggles (... after writing them.... after writing "Applicable to (*)" - streamline service...)
    - with prereqs 1&2 - complex challenge->response knocker daemon
        - IE: 
            - Find the ports running 'running' HTTP, SSH, DNS servers
                - send post request with *this*
                - send a SYN packet to the port running SSH - _do not respond_ to subsequent packets
                - DNS request for *this* domain
            - *Click* - port x unlocks to the true service y for host _you_
- Purple Team:
    - Recon:
        - Hardware (OUI) and OS (other passive traffic - bonjour, NBNS, SSDP, MDNS etc)
    - honeypot submodules/install/setup?
    - Detect basic successful exploits (Port redirection/timing)
        - Detect/prevent meterpreter/nc callbacks?
            - This may be ambitious - would require egghunt on potentially time sensitive data
                - is there a way to "hold" a stateful connection for analysis with heartbeats?
                - prone to middleman DOS, IE: Send massive payloads that trigger the egghunts to max out firewall resources
- Red Team:
    - MITM implementations (IPv4/6)

# More on why: recap of my journal 

</summary>


So, some of the code making up this project was written April 18th, 2024. I was deep-diving into scapy layers, for no other reason than network protocols have always been 'my thing', and scapy is a great framework which I was not very familiar with. 

`I am a hacker, enter my world...`

A few weeks later, (est. 8PM, April 26th, 2024):

I exposed a few ports to my PC, ones commonly used for web development, e.g. 8883, 8080, etc, to the internet. The simple/boring traffic of network broadcasts, casual browsing, etc, I was just hoping for someone/thing new/interesting to pop up while I messed around with various layers/socket types etc.

> Going on a deep

<details>
    <summary> tangent. </summary>

So it/they did. (est 10PM, same day)

A mirai variant was knocking, and (presumably for speed/mass-effectiveness) it didn't bother waiting for either notification of the port being blocked (`tcp->th_flags & TH_SYN`), or server acknowledgement (`tcp->th_flags & TH_RST`) - it just pushed the exploit request right in after that SYN... Had it waited, it would have received neither anyway - a `DROP` rule was in place.


I dug deeply into that router exploit attempt - identifying it as [CVE-2023-1389](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-1389), quickly discovered, and downloaded what turned out to be the initial bash script (first noted publically 2 weeks prior) to detect the architecture, and grab the architecture appropriate [stage 2 dropper](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/74c1e2cc3733bc1b5927f3b5497daab5a52fc4af3ca59b008a55dcf4ca520544/detection) 

I do not seem to have the raw binaries any more (I hold hope of finding them), but I did still have the sha256 hashes for them. 

If you have these, hand'em over! My archives are incomplete!
Those 4 architecture's are yet-to-be-uploaded to VirusTotal as well.

(No uploads prior to me for these hashes - so I presume no one dug this far.)

I lack details in my notes beyond this, but seem have been confident from what I had unpacked/reversed that I found the C2, and a front-end/admin-portal public: 45.128_232.208:33335 (no longer operating.)

At that point, it was April 27th, 4AM rolled around, and my fun was over with, but I did not forget this excercise as a month passed me by.

My take away thoughts:

- "If I were running these botnets, I would not be so 'inellegant' as to spam the whole internet with my lame publicly identified CVEs - at least scan first"

![FreakingIdiots!](src/visualization/assets/NapoleonDyna.jpg)
- "Wait, so what if I did scan first? Who's to say that *what I see*, **is** what it appears, even if every probe/response and byte is lining up 1:1 (as far as **my checks would go**) with what the vulnerable device would display?"
  - *Queue first bullet* of "Working" header, with that PoC written:
  - *various sub-thoughts dumped into the TODO section*
</details>

> TLDR: Mirai botnet hit a port with a weird/relatively new exploit, I fixated on it for a night, though the night turned into one of binary dissection, I returned to scapy, with a simple goal: I'm going to make a little responder app to emulate various services.

Had it stayed so simple, my summer would have been much more lively, as my friends would attest.

</description>

### End Game
A hard question for my breed- we see a gap in tooling, we fill it, some times (most times in my case) with paper clips, tape, and glue, among existing tooling.

Once that's together though, it becomes "how can I make this less-shitty, and/or more-novel?" which I had endless answers to. 

This time though, I found a simple concrete: 
- Fail2Ban + knocker + configuration parser
  - These 3 are simple enough, and provide real value-add over the former 2 as individual tools.

Though, I would love for it to be a 1-stop-shop for any team (Red, Blue, the general network operator, etc), the **Big TODO:** has simply gotten too big, and getting to this point has taken long enough(collectively a few hundred hours) that I don't see that happening (this year.)
